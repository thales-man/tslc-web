tslc-web
===============

this is the 'home page' for the striped lawn companies web site 'system'.

the application has been written using angular 10 and asp dot net core 3.1. it has made extensive use of the web framework components developed under <a href="https://github.com/thales-man/tiny-things" title="Tiny things">'framework 4'</a> of this account. to download and build this application you will need to download <a href="https://github.com/thales-man/tiny-things" title="tiny things">'framework 4'</a>, build and deploy to a private nu-get 'server' (or folder) all the packages required. you may also need to specify ip addresses, ports and content locations for all parts of the application to finally load. i believe i've given sufficient documentation in each of the packs to facilitate this; you may disagree, in that event i'm sorry. muddle through and you'll get there.

for a more in depth look at the program, it's components, history and development, go here <a href="https://tslc.ltd/posts/2020/09/new-site-development" title="new site development">new web site development work</a>.

enjoy! :)
